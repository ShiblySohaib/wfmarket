COMPLETED:
- Removed the limitation that showed only top 5 market results for each item. Now showing all available orders.
- Improved the hasDataChanged function to properly compare data content instead of just length, ensuring proper detection of data changes.
- Fixed "Last updated" timestamp to only update when data actually changes, not on every fetch operation.
